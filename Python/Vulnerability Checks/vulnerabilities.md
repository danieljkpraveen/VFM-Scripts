When writing Python scripts for automation, several common code vulnerabilities can occur, especially when handling untrusted input, external resources, or system operations. Hereâ€™s a list of some of the most relevant vulnerabilities you should be aware of:

### 1. Path Traversal
- **Description:** Manipulation of file paths to access files/directories outside the intended scope.
- **Example:** Using user input as part of a file path without validation.

### 2. Shell Injection (Command Injection)
- **Description:** Injecting arbitrary commands into system calls (e.g., os.system, subprocess).
- **Example:** Passing untrusted input to shell commands.

### 3. Insecure Deserialization
- **Description:** Loading data from untrusted sources using pickle, yaml.load, etc., can lead to code execution.
- **Example:** Using pickle.loads() on user-supplied data.

### 4. Insecure Use of eval()/exec()
- **Description:** Executing code from untrusted input.
- **Example:** Using eval() or exec() with unsanitized input.

### 5. Insecure Temporary File Handling
- **Description:** Creating temp files insecurely could allow race conditions or exposure to other users.
- **Example:** Not using the tempfile module securely.

### 6. Hardcoded Credentials/Secrets
- **Description:** Storing sensitive info in code, which can be leaked.
- **Example:** API keys, passwords hardcoded in scripts.

### 7. XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks
- **Description:** Parsing XML with vulnerable libraries enables attackers to access local files or network resources.
- **Example:** Using xml.etree.ElementTree without disabling external entity resolution.

### 8. SQL Injection
- **Description:** Constructing SQL queries directly from user input.
- **Example:** Using string formatting to build SQL statements.

### 9. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description:** Less common in pure automation scripts, but if output is web-accessible, XSS is possible.

### 10. Insecure Permissions (Privilege Escalation)
- **Description:** Scripts running with more privileges than required.
- **Example:** Running as root/admin unnecessarily.

### 11. Race Conditions
- **Description:** Improper handling of file/OS operations in multi-threaded or concurrent scripts.

### 12. Unvalidated Input
- **Description:** Accepting and using user input without validation or sanitization.
- **Example:** File uploads, network input.

### 13. Resource Injection
- **Description:** Allowing untrusted input to specify resources (e.g., file names, class names).

### 14. Information Disclosure
- **Description:** Logging sensitive data or exposing error messages with sensitive info.

### 15. Use of Outdated Libraries
- **Description:** Using dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

### 16. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Description:** If scripts fetch URLs based on user input, attackers may access internal services.

### 17. Unsafe YAML Loading
- **Description:** Using yaml.load instead of yaml.safe_load.

### 18. Unrestricted File Upload
- **Description:** Allowing any file type upload, leading to malicious files being executed.

### 19. Unsafe Pickle Usage
- **Description:** Using pickle to load untrusted data, leading to code execution.
